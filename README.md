# Transaction History

## Thought Process

- Timeline: With 7 days, I could use the first day only to understand the requirement, prepare some ideas. The next 4 days will focus on design, implement, testing, write document cycle. Finally, in the last 2 days, I will review everything again.
- Initial understanding: I think the core value of this program is the logic to process the data. The CLI interface, handling input and output should be completed quickly by using common libraries. The logic to process the data should be well organized for reusing purpose. I will go with 2 versions, the first one forcus on making the program work with simple, short data. The second one will focus on handling with a really big file, large data.

## Design Decisions

- Programming Language: this is a simple program which will evaluate programming and problem solving skill instead of applying technology or system design, so the programming language does not matter. Between Go and Java, Go is more famous for system program and CLI application. Also, Go has better performance and more efficient memory management than Java. Finally, it's a personal program and I have better resource using Go (more experience with it).
- Libraries and Frameworks: I belive standard libraries can cover most of the logic.
- Testing: standard `testing` package is good enough.
- Quality Attributes: I would choose 2 to 3 from Usability (this is the program for personal usage), Performance (in case I need to process large data), Testability (ensure the quality of the output), and Modifiability (so I could extend the program to help me in more tasks).
